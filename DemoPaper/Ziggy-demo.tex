\begin{abstract}
Data exploration has received much attention during the last few years. The
aim is to discover new, interesting queries in a possibly unfamiliar
database. Typically, explorers operate by trial and error: they write
a query, inspect the results and refine their specifications accordingly. In this
demo proposal, we present Ziggy, a system to help them understand the
results of their queries. Ziggy's aim is to complete an existing exploration system: it
assumes that users already have a query, but they do not know what is
interesting about it. To assist them, it detects characteristic views,
that is, small sets of columns in which the tuples in the results are different
from that in the rest of the database. Thanks to these views, our explorers
can understand what makes their query unique and ensure that they
considered everything their query had to offer.
